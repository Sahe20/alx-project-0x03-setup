# Reactify TS: Mastering Advanced TypeScript in React

This project is part of the **ALX React Pro Dev Curriculum** and serves as a milestone for mastering advanced TypeScript concepts in a React and Next.js environment. The application showcases best practices in component-based architecture, TypeScript typing, shared layouts, and modular UI design using TailwindCSS.
